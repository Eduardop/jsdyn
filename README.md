### Welcome to the JavaScript Dynamics Engine ###

To see it working, open samples/s01-hellocube.html in your browser. Also check out other samples in the samples folder.

Requires a browser that supports HTML5 and WebGL.

* The simulator is independent from the renderer.
* The simulator (jsdyn.js) has no dependencies.
* The samples uses O3D as a renderer - http://code.google.com/p/o3d/ (included in the 3rdparty folder).
